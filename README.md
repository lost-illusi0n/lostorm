# Lostorm
Lostorm is a simplistic and basic ORM to deal with PostgreSQL databases. Requiring very little boilerplate code, this ORM is lightweight and can be setup very quickly.
### Dependency Setup
##### Gradle
```
plugins {
    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt' version '1.4.0'
}
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
    kapt 'com.github.lost-illusi0n.lostorm:annotation-processor:1.3.3'
    implementation 'com.github.lost-illusi0n.lostorm:mapper:1.3.3'
    implementation 'com.github.lost-illusi0n.lostorm:annotations:1.3.3'
}
```
##### Maven
```

```
### How does this work?
In Lostorm, you work with ``Entity``s and data classes. These entities are autogenerated by dataclasses annotatated with the ``EntityDataClass`` annotation. This greatly reduces common boilerplate you might find in other ORMs. A common dataclass may look something like
```kotlin
@EntityDataClass data class Human(val name: String, val alive: Boolean)
```
This single line will create an entity that allows for strong typings in Lostorm.
